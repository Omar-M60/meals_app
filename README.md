# meals_app

A frontend Flutter Project in which you can view the recipies of meals, save those meals as favorites, choose the category of the meal you want to see (Italian, German, Hamburgers...), and filter what meals you want to see (Glutten-free, vegeterian...).

## Important to note
It is my second Flutter app project with the purpose of learning how to develop Flutter mobile apps. That's why the data is just hard-coded data, I'm planning to add the backend in the near future.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Appreciate the support
